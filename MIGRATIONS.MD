Take the code bases alchemi-web, alchemi-ai and console-cockpit.

In alchemi-web and alchemi-ai is basically about giving agentic workspaces to enterprise users, in a fashion where the admin can have a centralized control over the users, who can access what agents (through marketplace), who can use how many credits (budget allocation), and how can use what tools (through marketplace), being able to see audit logs.All this with multi-tenancy in mind, so that different accounts can have their own isolated environments, with their own users, agents, tools, and budgets. There is a also a super admin portal for the platform, where we can manage the accounts, and have a global view of the usage across all accounts.

in console-cockpit we have built on top of litellm with more enterprise features, such as user management, role-based access control, account based multi-tenancy.. This also has a super admin portal for the platform, where we can manage the accounts, and have a global view of the usage across all accounts.

I think we should have a centralized cockpit instead and I think we should make the console-cockpit as this centralized cockpit. I think much of the functionality in console-cockpit can be reused in alchemi-web and alchemi-ai, and we can have a shared codebase for the common features, such as user management, role-based access control, account based multi-tenancy, audit logs. And for the rest of the feature. Check the alchemi-web path in /cockpit/ for the current features in alchemi-web and alchemi-ai, and see how we can integrate them into a centralized cockpit that can serve both alchemi-web and alchemi-ai, and potentially other products in the future. This way we can have a more unified experience for the users, and also reduce the maintenance overhead of having multiple codebases for similar features. Some of the features that we can integrate into the centralized cockpit include:
Instead of having cost management inside alchemi-web and alchemi-ai, we should use the budget tracking features inside console-cockpit, for example we can have a budget allocation feature in the centralized cockpit per user, team and organization, where the admin can set a budget for each user, team or organization and as the use the models through this centralized cockpit, the costs will be tracked against their allocated budget, and the admin can have a clear view of how much budget is being used and how much is left. This way we can have a more consistent and centralized way of managing budgets across all products, and also provide more granular control to the admins over how the budgets are allocated and used.
And some features I think we need to port from alchemi-web and alchemi-ai to the centralized cockpit include:
- Agent management: We can have a centralized agent management system in the cockpit, where admins can create, edit and delete agents, and assign them to specific users or teams. alchemi-web path in /cockpit/marketplace and alchemi-web path in /cockpit/agentdef
- Tool management: Similar to agent management, we can have a centralized tool management system in the cockpit, where admins can manage the tools that are available to the users, and assign them to specific users or teams. alchemi-web path in /cockpit/connections


Do a thorough analysis of the current features in alchemi-web, alchemi-ai and console-cockpit and see how we can integrate them into the centralized cockpit. We should also consider the user experience and design of the centralized cockpit, to ensure that it is intuitive and easy to use for both admins and users. I think we need not worry about legacy code or migration as this will be a fresh production.

Come up with a detailed plan and roadmap for the development of the centralized cockpit, changes to alchemi-web and alchemi-ai, and the integration between them. This will require diligent attention to detail and careful planning to ensure a smooth transition and successful implementation of the centralized cockpit. 

Its not about just merging codebases, but basically want the alchemi-web and alchemi-ai to be clients of the centralized cockpit, where they can call the APIs of the centralized cockpit to manage users, agents, tools, budgets, and other features. This way we can have a more modular and scalable architecture, where the centralized cockpit can serve multiple products and clients, and we can also have a more consistent and unified experience for the users across all products.

One important think to remember, for alchemi-web and alchemi-ai we have a separate section called copilot in console-cockpit that manages these, it can reuse backend but needs to have seprarate, orgs and teams that need to be managed separately from the main console-cockpit orgs and teams, as they are specific to alchemi-web and alchemi-ai. This way we can have a clear separation of concerns and also ensure that the specific needs of alchemi-web and alchemi-ai are met, while still leveraging the common features and functionalities of the centralized cockpit. Also the llms (models) that are used in alchemi-web and alchemi-ai are specific to those products, so we need to have a way to manage them separately in the centralized cockpit. BAsically for the console and cockpit version, enterprises bring their own llms, so we need to have a way to manage those llms separately from the ones used in alchemi-web and alchemi-ai, which are more focused on providing agentic workspaces for enterprise users. The llms for copilot (aclhemi-web and alchemi-ai) are centrally managed by super admins, and the enterprises can choose from the available llms in the marketplace, and the mangement of these are tracked as credits (cost * CREDITS_FACTOR) and this is what is tracked in the budget allocation and cost management features in the centralized cockpit for management of copilot.
